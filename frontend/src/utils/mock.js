    `Here's how I'd approach your market positioning challenge:

**Start with the customer:** Don't begin with your product features. Begin with what problem you're solving for customers and why they should care. Amazon succeeded because we obsessed over customer needs, not our technology.

**Think long-term:** Most companies optimize for the next quarter. Your positioning should be built for where you want to be in 10 years, not 10 months. What's the big, audacious goal that this product serves?

**Invent backwards:** Write the press release for your product launch before you finish building it. This forces clarity on what success looks like and helps you communicate value simply.

**Test everything:** Your positioning is a hypothesis. Test it with real customers through A/B tests, surveys, and direct feedback. Let data, not opinions, guide your decisions.

Remember: "If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."`,
    
    // Steve Jobs advice  
    `Your positioning challenge requires the same ruthless focus we applied at Apple:

**Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication:** If you can't explain your product's value in one sentence, you don't understand it well enough. Strip away everything that doesn't matter until only the essential remains.

**Focus on the experience, not features:** People don't buy products, they buy better versions of themselves. How does your product make someone's life measurably better? That's your position.

**Say no to 1000 things:** Great positioning isn't about what you include—it's about what you exclude. The most powerful position is owning one clear benefit in the customer's mind.

**Make it feel inevitable:** When we launched the iPhone, we didn't position it as "another phone." We made it feel like the obvious future that finally arrived. Your product should feel like the natural next step, not a radical departure.

**Think different:** Everyone else is zigging with feature comparisons and rational benefits. Consider zagging with emotional resonance and aspirational messaging.

Remember: "People don't know what they want until you show it to them."`,

    `Let me give you a first principles approach to market positioning:

**Question everything:** Don't accept existing market categories. When we created Tesla, we didn't position against other electric cars—we questioned why cars couldn't be both sustainable AND the best driving experience. What fundamental assumptions can you challenge?

**10x thinking:** Incremental positioning leads to incremental results. Your product needs to be 10x better at something important, not 10% better at everything. What's your 10x advantage?

**Mission-driven positioning:** The best positions are tied to solving humanity's biggest problems. Tesla isn't selling cars—we're accelerating sustainable transport. SpaceX isn't selling rockets—we're making life multiplanetary. What mission does your product serve?

**Rapid iteration:** Launch your positioning, gather feedback, and iterate fast. We've changed Tesla's messaging dozens of times based on what resonates. Speed of learning beats perfection.

**Physics-based thinking:** Strip away all the marketing fluff and focus on the fundamental physics of your market. What are the immutable laws of your industry, and how can you work within or around them?

Remember: "The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that's changing quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks."`
